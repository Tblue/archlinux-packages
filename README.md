# Tblue's Arch Linux packages

This repository contains the
[PKGBUILD](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PKGBUILD)s for all of my
[Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org) packages which are not already maintained
in the [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR).

A list of my AUR packages can be viewed
[here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=m&K=Tblue) -- these are not
maintained in this Git repository since the AUR provides its own Git hosting.
